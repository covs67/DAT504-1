# DAT504

This repo will contain all the files and slides I will use or create during a session.

## homework
Check the directory for each session, the `readme.md` will contain any information about homework assignments.

For homework exercises weâ€™d like you to create a git repository for DAT504, where you publish your attempts at the exercises. Please create a folder structure with the weeks numbered, and sub directories for exercises from the session, book etc. So to submit the exercises for eloquent javascript this would be stored for example in `week-01/eloquent-javascript/chapter-02/looping-triangle.js`.

Please also create a `.gitignore` file in the root of your repo, and ignore `node_modules/` and other non-relevant files. For example my `.gitignore` looks like this:
```
.DS_Store
node_modules/
```

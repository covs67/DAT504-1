# Homework

As your homework assignments I’d like you to read a few chapters from the two website I mentioned during the session:

* [HTML & CSS Is Hard | A friendly web development tutorial](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/)
Read the chapter on flexbox and semantic HTML. As there is a spread of abilities in the group,  the people that feel slightly unfamiliar with HTML & CSS might want to have a look at earlier chapters as well that are covering the basics of HTML and CSS.
* [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
I’d like you to read the first 3 chapters (Values, Types and Operators, Program Structure and Functions) to fresh up on JavaScript. At the end of chapters there are some exercises we’d like you to try.

For homework exercises we’d like you to create a git repository for DAT504, where you publish your attempts at the exercises. Please create a folder structure with the weeks numbered, and sub directories for exercises from the session, book etc. So to submit the exercises for eloquent javascript this would be stored for example in `week-01/eloquent-javascript/chapter-02/looping-triangle.js`

If you get stuck with any of the exercises or git(hub), let me know and I'll try to help.

# Homework

1. Finish your implementation for the address book API allowing you to save, retrieve, filter and update people.
2. Expand the API by adding a new model for businesses and express endpoints so you can perform similar requests as to people. Add a few properties that will allow you to filter businesses, such as size of company, what kind of service they provide etc.
3. See if you can add new details and type of queries. Eg, can you sort your address book? Filter based on what hobbies a person has?

*BONUS*:
If you like a challenge and want to venture into new territory: add new functionality to the address book that will allow you to list people as employees (or CEO/owner/director?) of a business. Can you also show their place of employment if a when you look up a person?

## Submission
We'd like to see how everyone is getting on, so you'll have to submit your homework through the github repository as for last week. Please make sure you don't commit node_modules. In the root of your repo, create a file called `.gitignore` (don't forget the dot) and add a line with `node_modules/`. Now git should ignore this, you can see an example of the file in this repo.

I'm still waiting for my university email, if you have any questions for me send them to Karen and she can pass them along (or open an issue on this github repo).
